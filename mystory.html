    <h2 class="section-title">‚ú® My Story</h2>

    <p class="story-paragraph">
      My name is Himani Kapoor. I began my after school academic journey with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Aditi Mahavidhyalaya Delhi University in 2019, where I developed a strong foundation in business principles. My early career path led me to pursue a Master's in Human Resource Management(Distance program) from Jamia Millia Islamia in 2022 after completing my undergraduation ‚Äî a space where I explored the human side of organizations and built skills in communication, leadership, and organizational development.
    </p>

   <p class="story-paragraph">
     While studying, I simultaneously took on an on-the-job training opportunity in Human Resource Management at The Leela, a renowned hotel chain in March of 2023. My dedication and performance quickly led me to be promoted to the role of HR Associate within three months. I continued working there until November 2023.
    </p>

    <p class="story-paragraph">
      But as the world around me changed, so did my interests. Working in a fast-paced, people centric enviroment taught me a great deal about communication, leadership and organisational culture. It also made me realize something deeper, while I was managing people and processes, I was increasingly drawn towards backend systems and technological advancements that kept everything running.

    <p class="story-paragraph">
     This led me to reflect deeply on my career path. In November 2023, I took a courageous step and decided to change my career path. Afterward, I joined Edifecs in February 2024, where my career took a surprising but exciting turn. While working in this organization alongside tech teams and being exposed to the modern tech world, I discovered my growing interest in technology, particularly in the field of DevOps. This realization sparked a deep curiosity in me and opened the door to a world of tools, automation, cloud technologies, and infrastructure that I never imagined I'd be passionate about   </p>


    <p class="story-paragraph">
      To strengthen this transition, I enrolled in the MCA (Master of Computer Applications) program from IGNOU in January 2025 and dive deep into DevOps. I started learning tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, and more ‚Äî all on my own, with dedication and countless hours of hands-on practice.
    </p>

    <p class="story-paragraph">
      This website is a result of that journey. It‚Äôs not just a portfolio ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reflection of the mindset I carry: to keep learning, building, and evolving. From managing people to managing pipelines, this shift has been challenging but deeply fulfilling.
    </p>

    <p class="story-paragraph">
      Thank you for being here and witnessing a part of my transformation. This is just the beginning ‚Äî and I‚Äôm excited to see where it leads.
